### Some notes

This repository does not contain an implementation of the entire experiment of the paper. Instead,
it confirms the thesis's core algorithm in a small toy example.

Unlike paper, batch-wise optimization is not done.

L2-based regularization is not implemented. Entropy-based regularization only.

### Requirements
```
python3
tensorflow
matplotlib
seaborn
...
```

## Results

##### Source and Target
Source points are green and target points are red.

##### Monge Map Estimation
Source points are green and transported points are blue.

##### KDE on transported distribution
